Reiser4 support in GNU GRUB.

reiser4progs package has ability to build so called "stand alone"
libreiser4 library, which purpose is to provide reiser4 read only
support for enviromnents without libc, (that is without memory
manager, string functions, etc.), like GNU GRUB does work in.

In order to build such a library, apply --enable-stand-alone key to
./configure script in configuring time and type "make". This library
is pretty small and does not contain balancing code, journal code,
block allocator, etc. As GNU GRUB has strong limitation for its binary
images (used for embeding just after mbr and used for reading main
GRUB core), we strongly recomend you do not build in unused hash
plugins and extera checks code into "stand alone" library. This may
lead to unability to use reiser4 filesystem for booting.

Most convenient configure comand is the following:

./configure --disable-debug --enable-stand-alone
--disable-collisions-handling --disable-plugins-check
--disable-fnv1-hash --disable-rupasov-hash --disable-tea-hash

This assumes, that r5 hash is used in filesystem, so it is not
disabled here.
