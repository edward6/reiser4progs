FSCK.REISER4 WARNING

This is an experimental software yet, MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE USING IT! Do not 
run rebuild unless something is broken. If you have bad sectors on a drive 
it is usually a bad idea to continue using it. Then you probably should get
a working hard drive, copy the file system from the bad drive to the good
one -- dd_rescue is a good tool for that -- and only then run this program.
