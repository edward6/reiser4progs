 *
 *     . files being block aligned, and
 *
 *     . files never migrating on disk
 *
 * for example, boot loaders (LILO) need this.
 *
 * This ioctl should be used as
 *
 *     result = ioctl(fd, REISER4_IOC_UNPACK);
 *
 * File behind fd descriptor will be converted to the extents (if necessary),
 * and its stat-data will be updated so that it will never be converted back
 * into tails again.
