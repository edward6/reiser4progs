[LICENSING]

Reiser4 progs is hereby licensed under the Anti-Plagiarism License.

The Anti-Plagiarism License

Pre-amble:

At the time of writing (2004), distros commonly remove, diminish, or obscure
the credits of original authors from many programs so as to ensure that the
user has brand awareness primarily of the distro.  They have a strong
marketing incentive to do so, and there is no shame shown by them in the act.
This is a very real problem which has already affected many programs
(e.g. KDE, ReiserFS, many others).  Western academia has a strong tradition of
opposing plagiarism, and there are good societal reasons for ensuring that
persons are known for what they have done with precision.  Individual users
don't benefit as significantly from knowing who produced their software, and
so one cannot say that there is a market demand for better credits that is
sufficient to overpower the desire of the distros to be the only source users
know of to turn to for all their needs.  While individuals may not be well
motivated to ensure prominent and full crediting, society as a whole is.
Crediting is a powerful incentive to produce good works, and many have written
about the power of fame as a motivator for producing free software.  Society
needs accuracy in its recognition of its contributors.

The License: The Anti-plagiarism license is the Gnu Public License Version 2
with the following modification: you may not modify, remove, or obscure any
credits in the software unless your modification causes those credits to remain
equally prominent and to retain their wording.  You are not required to display
the credits if the computer has no effective display mechanism, or if you do not
distribute the software to others.

FAQ:

Q: Will this license lead to ads?

A: No, credits describe the contribution made to a project.  Ads describe a
product someone wants you to buy.  Ads are not the same as credits, and their
preservation is not protected by this license.

Q: Can we the distro preserve the credits but send the credits to /dev/null.

A: No.  How can you even ask such a question?

Q: Can I change the font? Can I move the credits to a different moment in the
user interaction to suit my installer?

A: Yes, if you make sure the credits make an equally effective/frequent
impression on the user.  If you have doubts about whether your changes are
fair, be courteous and ask the author and you'll find that most authors are
reasonable.

Q: What in this license prevents persons from making their name display
excessively annoyingly throughout the running of the program?  Isn't that a
flaw in the license?

A: The shovel doesn't stop the digger from creating a pit in the road that
endangers other people.  The license is a tool.  Whether you make an ass out
of yourself using it on the software you write is up to you.

Reiser4 progs specific licensing details.

Source code files that contain the phrase "licensing governed by
COPYING" are "governed files" throughout this file.  Governed
files are licensed under the GPL.  The portions of them owned by Hans
Reiser, or authorized to be licensed by him, have been in the past,
and likely will be in the future, licensed to other parties under
other licenses.  If you add your code to governed files, and don't
want it to be owned by Hans Reiser, put your copyright label on that
code so the poor blight and his customers can keep things straight.
All portions of governed files not labeled otherwise are owned by Hans
Reiser, and by adding your code to it, widely distributing it to
others or sending us a patch, and leaving the sentence in stating that
licensing is governed by the statement in this file, you accept this.
It will be a kindness if you identify whether Hans Reiser is allowed
to license code labeled as owned by you on your behalf other than
under the GPL, because he wants to know if it is okay to do so and put
a check in the mail to you (for non-trivial improvements) when he
makes his next sale.  He makes no guarantees as to the amount if any,
though he feels motivated to motivate contributors, and you can surely
discuss this with him before or after contributing.  You have the
right to decline to allow him to license your code contribution other
than under the GPL.

Further licensing options are available for commercial and/or other
interests directly from Hans Reiser: reiser@namesys.com.  If you interpret
the GPL as not allowing those additional licensing options, you read
it wrongly, and Richard Stallman agrees with me, when carefully read
you can see that those restrictions on additional terms do not apply
to the owner of the copyright, and my interpretation of this shall
govern for this license.
