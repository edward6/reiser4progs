Hans Reiser was the primary architect of Reiser4, but a whole team
chipped their ideas in.  He invested everything he had into Namesys
for 5.5 dark years of no money before Reiser3 finally started to work well
enough to bring in money.  He owns the copyright.

DARPA was the primary sponsor of Reiser4.  DARPA does not endorse
Reiser4, it merely sponsors it.  DARPA is, in solely Hans's personal
opinion, unique in its willingness to invest into things more
theoretical than the VC community can readily understand, and more
longterm than allows them to be sure that they will be the ones to
extract the economic benefits from.  DARPA also integrated us into a
security community that transformed our security worldview.

Vladimir Saveliev is our lead programmer, with us from the beginning,
and he worked long hours writing the cleanest code.  This is why he is
now the lead programmer after years of commitment to our work.  He
always made the effort to be the best he could be, and to make his
code the best that it could be.  What resulted was quite remarkable. I
don't think that money can ever motivate someone to work the way he
did, he is one of the most selfless men I know.

Alexander Lyamin was our sysadmin, and helped to educate us in
security issues.  Moscow State University and IMT were very generous
in the internet access they provided us, and in lots of other little
ways that a generous institution can be.

Alexander Zarochentcev (sometimes known as zam, or sasha), wrote the
locking code, the block allocator, and finished the flushing code.
His code is always crystal clean and well structured.

Nikita Danilov wrote the core of the balancing code, the core of the
plugins code, and the directory code.  He worked a steady pace of long
hours that produced a whole lot of well abstracted code.  He is our
senior computer scientist.

Vladimir Demidov wrote the parser.  Writing an in kernel parser is
something very few persons have the skills for, and it is thanks to
him that we can say that the parser is really not so big compared to
various bits of our other code, and making a parser work in the kernel
was not so complicated as everyone would imagine mainly because it was
him doing it...

Joshua McDonald wrote the transaction manager, and the flush code.
The flush code unexpectedly turned out be extremely hairy for reasons
you can read about on our web page, and he did a great job on an
extremely difficult task.

Nina Reiser handled our accounting, government relations, and much
more.

Ramon Reiser developed our website.

Beverly Palmer drew our graphics.

Vitaly Fertman developed librepair, userspace plugins repair code, fsck
and worked on developing libreiser4 and userspace plugins with Umka.

Yury Umanets (aka Umka) developed libreiser4, userspace plugins and 
userspace tools (reiser4progs).

Oleg Drokin (aka Green) is the release manager who fixes everything.
It is so nice to have someone like that on the team.  He (plus Chris
and Jeff) make it possible for the entire rest of the Namesys team to
focus on Reiser4, and he fixed a whole lot of Reiser4 bugs also.  It
is just amazing to watch his talent for spotting bugs in action.

Edward Shishkin wrote cryptcompress file plugin and other plugins
related to transparent crypto and compression support.

Ivan Shapovalov (aka Intelfx) implemented discard support, which is
useful for solid-state drives (SSDs).
