SEMANTIC & LOST+FOUND.

** Terms.

Base item - having this item plugin knows how to reach all other items. In the 
current implementation only compound directory items that do not have '.' and 
'..' are not base items.

Ambiguous object is one for which we cannot identify object plugin unambiguously.
If it can be an object of plugins of different groups, do not consider it as an 
object at all -- we even do not know its default plugin -- unless we reach it 
from its parent.

** Requirements.

An object which inherits from the parent must have a pointer to that parent.

** Idea.

All objects are considered as lost initially. Just check that root dir exists 
before the start. Then for any not CHECKED item try to recover the object, reach 
its parent and recover the whole subtree.

If it is not possible to recover the object OBJ1 given its item, that is not a 
base item, skip it for now. This (recovering) can be done later by trying to 
recover OBJ1's child or parent---then we have a pointer to the StatData of OBJ1 
or some other item which is a base item of the object OBJ1.

Object inherits its properties from the parent so if plugin of the object is 
ambiguous, then try to reach the parent and its parent until plugin become 
unambiguous. If this fails, wait for reaching this object from some other object 
when the plugin will be figured out. If it fails also, link it to LOST+FOUND and 
recover with the default plugin.

** Algorithm.

1. Semantic pass.
(a) Object body recovery given an unCHECKED item or the key of some base item.
  - If object plugin is detected, recover the object body, all items get marked 
    as CHECKED.
  - If the object was found through some child and that child can provide its 
    key (key of SD) recover the link to the child.
  - If child is checked, mark it REACHABLE, nlink++, otherwise do nothing.
(b) Child-parent link recovery, independent of the (a) recovery result.
  - If parent pointer can be obtained and parent exists, do (a) for unCHECKED 
    parent or (a) without checking for CHECKED parent.
  - Do (b) for the parent which has been unCHECKED, or just try to obtain 
    plugins to be inhereted going upwards.
  - Do not link anything to LOST+FOUND.
(c) Run Semantic Recursive Traverse Pass from the object reached at (b) downward 
    until we reach ambiguous objects. Ambiguous objects can be reached from an 
    object linked to nowhere, otherwise plugins are inhereted from the parent or
    set by default (see requirements). 
    Objects that have parent pointer that does not match the current parent, are 
    checked, marked CHECKED, nlink++, but not REACHED, and their subtrees are 
    checked until ambiguous objects are reached.


Result.
Everything that was linked to some objects or was recovered with all their subtrees.
There are left some objects which are not reachable from the root:
(a) recovered unREACHED objects that parent pointers point to nowhere or to (c), 
    subtrees of these objects are limited by ambiguous objects from the bottom;
(b) recovered unREACHED objects that do not keep parent pointers with their whole 
    subtrees recovered (see requirements);
(c) ambiguous objects that keep parent pointer, able or unable to provide it. that
    pointer can be ambiguous also.
 
2. Lost & found pass.  
(a) Take an unREACHABLE object
(b) If the it does not keep a parent pointer or keep it but unable to provide it or
    that parent pointer is ambiguous, link it to LOST+FOUND.
    If it keeps a parent pointer and that parent can be found, go upwards until 
    we reach the unREACHABLE object whose parent cannot be find or whose parent 
    pointer cannot be obtained. Link it to LOST+FOUND.
(c) Recover the object linked to LOST+FOUND by default, without marking it REACHABLE.
(d) Recover the link to the child on the base of which this object was 
    reached.
(e) Recover the whole subtree of the linked object. For each child which
    is unREACHABLE check that it is not linked to LOST+FOUND, otherwise unlink 
    it from their.

2. Semantic pass cleanup.
Do Semantic Recursive Traverse Pass from the root, eliminate all UNREACHED objects, 
ambiguous objects, and recover property inheritance. If some object with a parent 
pointer which does not match the current parent found, skip it---inheritance does 
not work here.

There should not be any unCHECKED and unREACHABLE stuff now. Otherwise 
it can be cleaned later on FSCK CLEANUP PASS. Well, I hope that there is 
no need in this another pass.
