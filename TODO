* implement tree_resize() and tree_copy().

* improve tree_adjust_node() to be able to stop if memory pressure is
  gone.

* make debugfs use librepair. Move all print stuff to librepair.

* change R4Sb magic to Reiser4Sb both in progs and in kernel code.

* implement tree_pack() function, which will pack tree on leaf level
  in order to make it well packed and thus occupied less nodes on
  device. This is needed for using less space and especially important
  in fsck when tail <--> extent convertion is running.

* implement key collisions handling in tree_lookup().

* remove one of reiser4_key_t and key_entity_t.

* move plugin directory to libreiser4 directory. Maintain own plugin
  directory in librepair. Move all repair code from libreiser4/plugin/*
  to librepair/plugin/*.

* should we introduce two stat data related methods 
  something like load_sd() and save_sd() like kernel does?

* fix unalligned access on Itanium2.

* dumpfs utility.

* finish pack/unpack (add journal metadata).

* plugin inheritance for objects.

* big digits stat data fields format change.

* change balancing algorithm from recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* online/offline resizer/repacker, manual page resizefs.
* implement credits showing durring mkfs.
