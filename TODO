* fix reiser4_print_* to make them use different streams in order
  do not eraise previous print result, as it may be used in the same
  function as next one. 

* make tree_insert() code paths shorter, that it do nor use lots of
  checks of the same conditions and calculations like needed space.

* check all place_fetch() occurences and remove redundant ones.

* improve tree drying out and growing up in the sence of doing this
  automaticaly. For instance, if tree_remove() removes lat item from
  root node and releases it, tree should be dried out automatically in
  this moment. It would let us to call tree_remove() and tree_detach()
  from tree_dryout().

* improve tree_adjust_node() to be able to stop if memory pressure is
  gone.

* make debugfs use librepair. Move all print stuff to librepair.

* change R4Sb magic to Reiser4Sb both in progs and in kernel code.

* implement key collisions handling in tree_lookup().

* remove key_entity_t and use reiser4_key_t everywhere it is needed.
  Declare it in plugin.h and make in such a way public available for
  plugins. Rename node_t to reiser4_node_t and place_t to
  reiser4_place_t.

  All these types are basic reiser4 type available to be used on all
  abstraction levels.

* move plugin directory to libreiser4 directory. Maintain own plugin
  directory in librepair. Move all repair code from libreiser4/plugin/*
  to librepair/plugin/*.

* should we introduce two stat data related methods 
  something like load_sd() and save_sd() like kernel does?

* fix unalligned access on Itanium2.

* dumpfs utility.

* implement tree_resize() and tree_copy().

* finish pack/unpack (add journal metadata).

* plugin inheritance for objects.

* big digits stat data fields format change.

* change balancing algorithm from recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* online/offline resizer/repacker, manual page resizefs.
* implement credits showing durring mkfs.
