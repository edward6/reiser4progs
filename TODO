* add option to measurefs, which will introduce some kind of filter 
  for file fragmentation calculating.

* insert an extent among internal items may require perform shift and
  on other hands, insert of an item (nor extent or nodeptr) may 
  require to perform so called drilling on the twig level.

* --print-journal option handling code in debugfs.

* should we print blocks, that belong to some of fs objects 
  (block allocator, etc) while handling --print-block option?

* special file plugin and special files support in debugfs.

* big digits stat data fields storing format change.

* there should be an ability to work with symlinks from the API.
  Currently if we open a symlink we just "follow" it and then work
  with object it points to.

* writing symlink may require expanding the node. Or we should do 
  not allow write symlinks at all? Write method may just remove old 
  stat data and insert new one.

* some kind of flush is needed for libreiser4.

* extents handling code.

* change balancing algorithm from the recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* make GRUB working in its native mode (make reiser4 in GRUB less size 
  that it is for now).
