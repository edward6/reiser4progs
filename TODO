* handle holes overwriting in extent write code.

* implement more sophisticated memory pressure detect code.
  Probably it should take into account memory available at the moment
  of start and calculate numberof blocks in cache.

* remove hardcoded hash table sizes for formatted nodes and
  unformatted ones. Probably it should depend on memory pressure nodes
  limit in order to make hash collisions less and thus, to speedup
  loaded nodes access.

* fix reiser4_print_*. This print stuffshould be moved to libaal.

* check all place_fetch() occurences and remove redundant ones.

* change R4Sb magic to Reiser4Sb both in progs and in kernel code.

* implement key collisions handling in tree_lookup().

* remove key_entity_t and use reiser4_key_t everywhere it is needed.
  Declare it in plugin.h and make in such a way public available for
  plugins. Rename node_t to reiser4_node_t and place_t to
  reiser4_place_t.

  All these types are basic reiser4 type available to be used on all
  abstraction levels.

* move plugin directory to libreiser4 directory. Maintain own plugin
  directory in librepair. Move all repair code from libreiser4/plugin/*
  to librepair/plugin/*.

* fix unalligned access on Itanium2.

* dumpfs utility.

* implement tree_resize() and tree_copy().

* finish pack/unpack (add journal metadata).

* plugin inheritance for objects.

* big digits stat data fields format change.

* change balancing algorithm from recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* online/offline resizer/repacker, manual page resizefs.
* implement credits showing durring mkfs.
