* implement files removing and debug direntry40_remove stuff.

* implement reiser4_tree_write function.

* insert an extent among internals may require perform shift and
  on other hands, insert of an item (nor extent or nodeptr) may 
  require to perform so called drilling on the twig level.

* add limits to balancing code (limit on moved items, units and 
  bytes)

* --print-journal option handling code in debugfs.

* --print-block-alloc should also be able to print bitmap, not just
  the info about it like used blocks, free blocks, etc.

* finish --print-block handling code in debugfs.

* special file plugin and its support in debugfs.

* big digits stat data fields storing format change.

* smart bitmap working functions (copy, invert, etc).

* there should be an ability to work with symlinks from the API.
  Currently if we open a symlink we just "follow" it and then work
  with object it points to.

* return value from the all low level plugin functions should be raised 
  up to the libreiser4 level.

* writing symlink may require expanding the node. Or we should do 
  not allow write symlinks? Write method may just remove old stat
  data and insert new one.

* repacking is needed after tree is created by reiser4progs. Or we
  should produce the tree in the right order.

* node plugin insert probably should be renamed into write.

* should we move out all bitmap's and alloc's functions which do not work 
  with regions and rename the rest in more simple maner (without region)?

* FIBMAP ioctl implementation in reiser4.

* conform reiser4 and reiser4progs to be worked with LILO and GRUB.
