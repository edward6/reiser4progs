* should we split reiser4_fs_create and reiser4_fs_open onto separate
  functions?

* shift method for item plugins.

* left shifting for direntry40 item plugin

* --print-journal and --print-alloc options in debugfs.

* FIBMAP ioctl implementation in reiser4

* something like print_block method for format, journal and block
  allocator plugins.

* aal_block_t buffer list on device layer

* special file plugin.

* copy bitmap functions Vitaly need

* few disk-format changes (direntry format, big digits storing in stat data)

* callbacks in tree_insert and tree_remove functions

* fix gpart to wotk with more recent reiserfs than version 3.5.x

* fix reiser4_tree_attach
	(1) hardcoded nodeptr plugin id
	(2) node to be attached may contain an extent as the first item

* improve balacing for the case when we are going to insert new unit
  at the end of last item in node. Suppose right neighbour exists and
  has enough free space. In this case we should insert new unit into
  right neighbour, not int onew allocated node. This will improve node
  packing substantionaly.
