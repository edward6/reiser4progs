* cleanups in sym40 plugin.

* add option to measurefs, which will introduce some kind of filter 
  for file fragmentation calculating.

* should we print blocks, that belong to some of fs objects 
  (block allocator, etc) while handling --print-block option?

* special file plugin and special files support in debugfs.

* big digits stat data fields storing format change.

* there should be an ability to work with symlinks from the API.
  Currently if we open a symlink we just "follow" it and then work
  with object it points to.

* some kind of flush is needed for libreiser4.

* change balancing algorithm from the recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* online/offline resizer/repacker.
