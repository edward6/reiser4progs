* fix attach node with key collisions.

* overview sources and eliminate all not needed differences between
  kernel code and libreiser4.

* handle holes overwriting in extent write code.

* find out how much tree cache size affects performance of tree
  operations.

* remove hardcoded hash table sizes for formatted nodes and
  unformatted ones. Probably it should depend on memory pressure nodes
  limit in order to make hash collisions less and thus, to speedup
  loaded nodes access.

* move plugin directory to libreiser4 directory. Maintain own plugin
  directory in librepair. Move all repair code from libreiser4/plugin/*
  to librepair/plugin/*.

* fix unalligned access on Itanium2.

* dumpfs utility.

* implement tree_resize() and tree_copy().

* plugin inheritance for objects.

* big digits stat data fields format change.

* change balancing algorithm from recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* online/offline resizer/repacker, manual page resizefs.
* implement credits showing durring mkfs.
