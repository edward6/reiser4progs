  directory in librepair. Move all repair code from libreiser4/plugin/*
  to librepair/plugin/*.

* probably we should perform tail convertion by chunks of more than
  4096 bytes long? Then what chunk size should be used?

* should we introduce two stat data related methods 
  something like load_sd() and save_sd() like kernel does?

* cleanups in item modify and access methods. Do we realy need fetch()
  and update()?

* fix tree_copy(). It should be able to copy extents too.
