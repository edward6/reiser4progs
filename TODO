  fragmentation calculating.

  on other hands, insert of an item (nor extent or nodeptr) may 
  require to perform so called drilling on the twig level.

* --print-journal option handling code in debugfs.

* --print-block-alloc should also be able to print bitmap, not just
  the info about it like used blocks, free blocks, etc.

* finish --print-block handling code in debugfs.

* special file plugin and special files support in debugfs.

* there should be an ability to work with symlinks from the API.
  Currently if we open a symlink we just "follow" it and then work
  with object it points to.

* writing symlink may require expanding the node. Or we should do 
  not allow write symlinks at all? Write method may just remove old 
  stat data and insert new one.

* some kind of flush is needed for libreiser4.

* change balancing algorithm from the recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.
