* implement tree_pack() function, which will pack treeon leaf level in
  order to make it well packed and thus occupied less nodes on device. 
  This is needed for using less space and especially important in fsck
  when tail <--> extent convertion is running.

* return back node40 function for fusing two mergeable items if
  they both lie in the same node.

* implement key collisions working code in tree_lookup().

* remove one of reiser4_key_t and key_entity_t.

* move plugin directory to libreiser4 directory. Maintain own plugin
  directory in librepair. Move all repair code from libreiser4/plugin/*
  to librepair/plugin/*.

* make reg40 plugin to use the ability to make tail convertion with
  chunks different than default ones.

* should we introduce two stat data related methods 
  something like load_sd() and save_sd() like kernel does?

* cleanups in item modify and access methods. Do we realy need fetch()
  and update()?

* fix tree_copy(). It should be able to copy extents too.

* fix unaligned access on Itanium2.

* dumpfs utility.

* finish pack/unpack (add journal metadata).

* plugin inheritance for objects.

* big digits stat data fields format change.

* change balancing algorithm from recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* online/offline resizer/repacker, manual page resizefs.
* implement credits showing durring mkfs.
