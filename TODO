* all functions which return errno_t should return real errno, not just -1.

* should we have reset method in object plugins? does call like seek(obj, 0) will 
  not be convenient enough

* should we split reiser4_fs_create and reiser4_fs_open onto separate functions?
* reiser4_joint_realize may be improved by rid of lookup

* move the all common code of reg40 and dir40 plugins to separate file and let them 
  use it.

* rewrite progs/libmisc/profile.c in order to be using the last changes in plugin 
  header structure.

* should we use node print method for printing the all node items?
