* all functions which return errno_t should return real errno, not just -1.

* should we have reset method in object plugins? does call like seek(obj, 0) will 
  not be convenient enough

* should we have uint32_t additional param (unit pos) in item plugin functions?
* should we split reiser4_fs_create and reiser4_fs_open onto separate functions?
* reiser4_joint_realize may be improved by rid of lookup
* probably we should do not have sdext specific methods, like get_mode, set_mode 
  in stat40 plugin
* move the all common code of reg40 and dir40 plugins to separate file and let them 
  use it.
* rewrite progs/libmisc/profile.c in order to be using the last chnages in plugin 
  header structure.
* what about tree plugin? it sounds odd? at the moment we have two kinds of tree 
  which we probably should support. 

(1) reiser4 tree: emtpy tree contains twig node and leaf root directory lies in, 
    node pointers on all levels are items, LEAF_LEVEL + 1 contains not just node 
    pointers, but also extents.
(2) reiser3 tree: empty tree contains just leaf with root directory, node pointers
    on all levels > LEAF_LEVEL are not items, but fully differnt structure, on level
    LEAF_LEVEL + 1 we have not extents.

Can we eliminate these differences inside current design of tree code?
