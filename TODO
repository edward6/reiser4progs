* --print-journal options in debugfs.

* --print_block-alloc should also nbe able to print bitmap, not just
  some info about it like used, free blocks, etc.

* something like "print_block" method for format, journal and block
  allocator plugins.

* special file plugin.

* big digits stat data fields storing format change.

* update parent directory fields (nlink, etc) when creating file or
  directories.

* smart bitmap working functions (copy, invert, etc).

* special files browsing in debugfs.

* there should be an ability to work with symlinks from the API.
  Currently if we open a symlink we just "follow" it and then work
  with object it points to.

* insert an extent among internals may require perform shift and
  on other hands, insert of an item (nor extent or nodeptr) may 
  require to perform so called drilling on the twig level.

* improve work with keys in API and plugins. The problem is that we 
  always need the key plugin. Where should we take it everytime?

* return value from the all low level plugin functions should be raised 
  up to the libreiser4 level.

* debug reiser4_tree_remove function.

* probably item_ops need to be rewtiten somehow in order to be able to
  satisfy fsck requirements like rewriting.

* FIBMAP ioctl implementation in reiser4.

* conform reiser4 and reiser4progs to be worked with LILO and GRUB.

* copy methods in node API.

* writing symlink may require expanding the node. Or we should do 
  not allow write symlinks? Write method may just remove old stat
  data and insert new one.

* repacking is needed after tree is created by reiser4progs.
