* update all headers in progsto using the following style for defines
  #define &PROG_$FILE_H

* comments in journal plugin.

* remove all dirty(), clean() etc. functions and replace them with one
  function like set_state().

* improve fs components initializing (block allocator, format,
  etc). For now all they need lots of params, but all params are
  almost the same: device fs lies on, blksize, etc. All these params
  may be put into some struct called fs_desc and this fs_desc may be
  passed to all components in init time.

* improve data writing in tree.c. There should be call to item plugin
  in order to determine is it enough space in tree to insert data or
  not.

* fix tree_copy(). It should be able to copy extents too.

* fix unaligned access on Itanium2.

* dumpfs utility.

* finish pack/unpack (add journal metadata).

* plugin inheritance for objects.

* big digits stat data fields format change.

* change balancing algorithm from recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* online/offline resizer/repacker, manual page resizefs.
* implement credits showing durring mkfs.
