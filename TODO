* all functions which return errno_t should return real errno, not just -1.

* should we have reset method in object plugins? does call like seek(obj, 0) will 
  not be convenient enough

* should we split reiser4_fs_create and reiser4_fs_open onto separate functions?
* reiser4_joint_realize may be improved by rid of lookup

* probably we should do not have sdext specific methods, like get_mode, set_mode 
  in stat40 plugin. It is because we are making the hardwired limitation on stat
  data extentions contant. The idea is that, they may may have any structure.

* move the all common code of reg40 and dir40 plugins to separate file and let them 
  use it.

* rewrite progs/libmisc/profile.c in order to be using the last chnages in plugin 
  header structure.

* add fetch and update functions into item.c
* add reiser4_joint_blk function
