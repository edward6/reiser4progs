* eliminate stat40_belongs method.

* should we use sdext_entity_t in sdext plugin interface?

* implement reiser4_tree_write function needed for fsck.

* solve the problem with that, the item plugins cannot rely on item.len 
  due to its changing by the node plugin before calling item plugin.

* insert an extent among internal items may require perform shift and
  on other hands, insert of an item (nor extent or nodeptr) may 
  require to perform so called drilling on the twig level.

* add limits to balancing code (limit on moved items, units and 
  bytes)

* --print-journal option handling code in debugfs.

* --print-block-alloc should also be able to print bitmap, not just
  the info about it like used blocks, free blocks, etc.

* finish --print-block handling code in debugfs.

* special file plugin and special files support in debugfs.

* big digits stat data fields storing format change.

* smart bitmap working functions (copy, invert, etc).

* there should be an ability to work with symlinks from the API.
  Currently if we open a symlink we just "follow" it and then work
  with object it points to.

* writing symlink may require expanding the node. Or we should do 
  not allow write symlinks? Write method may just remove old stat
  data and insert new one.

* repacking is needed after tree is created by libreiser4.

* should we move out all bitmap's and alloc's functions which do not work 
  with regions and rename the rest in more simple maner (without region)?
