* tree_split() was able do not only allocate new nodes, but shift
  items into neighbour first.

* describe in README how to build reiser4progs, what to do if proper 
  libaal is not found, how to build libreiser4-alone in order to use 
  it with GNU GRUB, configure options etc.

* add option to measurefs, which will introduce some kind of filter 
  for file fragmentation calculating.

* implement drilling (the case when we're going to insert an item to 
  leaf level, but lookup stumbled on twig level because of an extent).

* should we print blocks, that belong to some of fs objects 
  (block allocator, etc) while handling --print-block option?

* special file plugin and special files support in debugfs.

* big digits stat data fields storing format change.

* there should be an ability to work with symlinks from the API.
  Currently if we open a symlink we just "follow" it and then work
  with object it points to.

* writing symlink may require expanding the node. Or we should do 
  not allow write symlinks at all? Write method may just remove old 
  stat data and insert new one.

* some kind of flush is needed for libreiser4.

* change balancing algorithm from the recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* make GRUB working in its native mode (make reiser4 in GRUB less size 
  that it is for now).

* online/offline resizer/repacker.
