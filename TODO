* insert an extent among internal items may require perform shift and
  on other hands, insert of an item (nor extent or nodeptr) may 
  require to perform so called drilling on the twig level.

* implement reiser4_tree_write function needed for fsck.

* should we use sdext_entity_t in sdext plugin interface?

* solve the problem with that, the item plugins cannot rely on item.len 
  due to it is changing by the node plugin before calling item plugin.

* --print-journal option handling code in debugfs.

* --print-block-alloc should also be able to print bitmap, not just
  the info about it like used blocks, free blocks, etc.

* finish --print-block handling code in debugfs.

* special file plugin and special files support in debugfs.

* big digits stat data fields storing format change.

* smart bitmap working functions (copy, invert, etc).

* there should be an ability to work with symlinks from the API.
  Currently if we open a symlink we just "follow" it and then work
  with object it points to.

* writing symlink may require expanding the node. Or we should do 
  not allow write symlinks at all? Write method may just remove old 
  stat data and insert new one.

* some kind og flush is needed for libreiser4.

* change balancing algorithm from the recursive to task oriented one
  like kernel does.

* should we move out all bitmap's and alloc's functions which do not work 
  with regions and rename the rest in more simple maner (without region)?
