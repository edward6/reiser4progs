* all functions which return errno_t should return real errno, not just -1.
* add INVALID_BLK macro and return it from the all blk-returning functions as error value.

* should we have reset method in object plugins? does call like seek(obj, 0) will not be 
  convenient enough

* should we throw out uint32_t additional param (unit pos) from item plugin functions?
* should items have read/write methods?
* should we split reiser4_fs_cerate and reiser4_fs_open onto separate functions?
