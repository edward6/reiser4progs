* all functions which return errno_t should return real errno, not just -1.

* should we have reset method in object plugins? does call like seek(obj, 0) will not be 
  convenient enough

* should we have uint32_t additional param (unit pos) in item plugin functions?
* should items have read/write methods? or they should be called insert/remove?
* should we split reiser4_fs_create and reiser4_fs_open onto separate functions?
* probably tree traverse function should belong to the tree?
* reiser4_joint_realize may be improved by rid of lookup
