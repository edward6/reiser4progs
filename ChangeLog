2014-06-28
	discard option to mkfs -- discard device at filesystem creation
	time (for SSD drives)

	Fixup in librepair/twig_scan.c: cb_item_region_check().
2013-05-03
	1.0.8 version
2013-05-03
	Fixups in fsck.reiser4: repair a special kind of corruptions
	appeared due to software bugs in earlier kernels.

	mkfs.reiser4 now enables intelligent compression with lzo1
	algorithm by default. If you want to create reiser4 without
	compression, then override the default plugin set with the
	"-o create=reg40" option.
2008-01-09
	1.0.7 version.
2008-01-09
	Alias -p "preen" to -a "auto" for fsck.
	Bugfixes:
	- fixed bugs in CryptoCompression object plugin (incorrect handling
	of corrupted compressed bodies).
	- suppress messages about wrong bytes for CryptoCompression
	objects	as in most cases it is because kernel doesn't support
	i_blocks and i_bytes for such objects because of performance
	issues. If wrong bytes is the result of fatal corruption, then
	fsck will detect and report it.
